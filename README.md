# WRF Yellow Sea

For this project, we run the wrf real case in a 2-nested domain over the yellow to observe marine fog and do forecasting for the FATIMA project. The FATIMA project essentially is a ship navigating through the yellow sea and collecting meaningful data to study marine fog.

### WRF-ARW Modeling System  ###

We request that all new users of WRF please register. This allows us to better determine how to support and develop the model. Please register using this form:[https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/wrf-regist.php](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/wrf-regist.php).

For an overview of the WRF modeling system, along with information regarding downloads, user support, documentation, publications, and additional resources, please see the WRF Model Users' Web Site: [https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/).

## Documentation

We held daily meetings for the FATIMA project during the month of June and July 2023 at 9 p.m. EST to give a 3-day forecasts for the ship. 

The PowerPoint slides for the daily meetings are given on [here.](http://www.yorku.ca/pat/FATIMA-WRF/Yellow%20Sea%20daily%20forecasts/index.html)

We ran the simulation and then plotted the 2m-relative humidity and the cloud mixing ratio (g/kg) for the Yellow sea and then we also plotted the relative humidity against height to be able to better identify marine fog or low-level clouds. The graphs for relative humidity vs height below are at different platforms in the sea where measurements were being taken and also they were aligned with the path of the ship. 

Below, I have a short gif for a 3-day forecasts on the 5th July where we were able to see a low-pressure system coming from the South and travelling up North of the Yellow sea.  


## Demo

This was the forecast for 5th July 2023. The westerly winds change to southerly winds. Some moisture was present along the coastlines as well around 12:00 UTC.
